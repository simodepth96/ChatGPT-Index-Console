# OpenAI URL Inspection Tool

This project offers an experimental Streamlit application designed to test whether a given webpage is:

1. **Cached in OpenAI’s internal index**, or
2. **Fetched live via ChatGPT’s web search (grounding)**

According to the official [OpenAI Web Search documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search#live-internet-access), models can operate either on cached/indexed content or perform a live fetch, depending on the `external_web_access` setting.
By default, **ChatGPT Search uses live web access**, but internal caching appears to exist to avoid repeatedly refetching identical content.

This tool explores whether a URL is included in OpenAI’s cached index and doesn't need a live search from the web.

## Using the App

The [Streamlit app](https://openai-index-console.streamlit.app/) allows you to:

* Provide a URL
* Check if a page exists in OpenAI's cache (default `external_web_access: False`)
* If a URL is not featured, the app infers whether the page:

  * **Exists in OpenAI’s cached index**
  * Is **blocked by JS / CSR rendering**
  * Requires **fresh grounding** to be interpreted

---

## Background & Motivation

OpenAI’s documentation hints at an internal cached index used to speed up or stabilise responses generated by ChatGPT-User. Direct confirmation is scarce, but behaviour suggests:

* OpenAI sometimes **serves pre-indexed HTML snapshots**
* When unavailable, ChatGPT relies on **web search grounding**
* When both fail (e.g., heavy CSR), ChatGPT may:

  * Produce thin, incomplete summaries
  * Rely on **semantic proximity**, similar to TF-IDF retrieval
  * Infer content from *related sites* in the same topical cluster

## 🔍 Observations From Tests

An example of a page significantly reliant on JavaScript to build the rendering path was used.
Its navigation and `<head>` content depend on CSR JavaScript, which **OpenAI’s crawlers cannot execute**.

### **Testing With Declared IP Location (London, UK)**

With IP location set manually:

* ChatGPT-User fails executing JavaScript blockers
* The output is concise, probably less prone to hallucinations

---

### **Testing Without IP Location**

When location is *not* specified:

* ChatGPT-User can't overcome the JavaScript blockers
* The output becomes more verbose and more exposed to hallucinations.
* ChatGPT-User may reference related domains (e.g., *lopesan.com*) from a broad cached index. It would be interesting to learn how the model identifies the closest match within the index (e.g; TF-IDF?).
  
This hints that ChatGPT-User may synthesize answers even without accessing the target page, by leveraging neighbouring documents or topic clusters.

### **Testing a JavaScript-Free Page Without IP Location**

When a page is *free from JavaScript dependency* and location is *not specified*:

<img width="1392" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a853372-f75c-4e26-8dd8-464ed457b8e6" />

* ChatGPT-User can access the page in the cached OpenAI's index
* The answer returned is structured but may not appear as concise.

### **Testing a JavaScript-Free Page With Declared IP Location**

When a page is *free from JavaScript dependency* and location is *specified*:

<img width="1357" height="482" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/694cb208-9eb2-4da1-ac24-32c8e1e25ab4" />

* ChatGPT-User can access the page in the cached OpenAI's index
* The answer returned is structured and may appear a bit more concise.

## 💭 Interpretation & Open Questions

The tests suggest that OpenAI likely keeps a cached index of webpages.

When a page isn’t available or relies on JavaScript, ChatGPT may fill in answers using related pages from the cache.

TL;DR - ChatGPT can often give structured answers without directly accessing the page, relying on cached content and related topics.

However, this behaviour raises a few interesting questions:

* How does ChatGPT pick the “closest match” when a page is missing?
* Does user location affect which cached content is used?
* Does user IP influence grounding behaviour or cached index selection?

## 🙌 Feedback Welcomed

If you’ve observed similar behaviour or have insights into OpenAI’s caching, retrieval, or grounding mechanisms, please feel free to share your thoughts.
This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome — especially improvements around rule-based conditional clauses that serves the interpretation output.
