# OpenAI URL Inspection Tool

This project offers an experimental Streamlit application designed to test whether a given webpage is:

1. **Cached in OpenAI’s internal index**, or
2. **Fetched live via ChatGPT’s web search (grounding)**

According to the official [OpenAI Web Search documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search#live-internet-access), models can operate either on cached/indexed content or perform a live fetch, depending on the `external_web_access` setting.
By default, **ChatGPT Search uses live web access**, but internal caching appears to exist to avoid repeatedly refetching identical content.

This tool explores whether a URL is included in OpenAI’s cached index and doesn't need a live search from the web.

## Using the App

The [Streamlit app](https://openai-index-console.streamlit.app/) allows you to:

* Provide a URL
* Check if a page exists in OpenAI's cache (default `external_web_access: False`)
* If a URL is not featured, the app infers whether the page:

  * **Exists in OpenAI’s cached index**
  * Is **blocked by JS / CSR rendering**
  * Requires **fresh grounding** to be interpreted

---

## Background & Motivation

OpenAI’s documentation hints at an internal cached index used to speed up or stabilise responses generated by ChatGPT-User. Direct confirmation is scarce, but behaviour suggests:

* OpenAI sometimes **serves pre-indexed HTML snapshots**
* When unavailable, ChatGPT relies on **web search grounding**
* When both fail (e.g., heavy CSR), ChatGPT may:

  * Produce thin, incomplete summaries
  * Rely on **semantic proximity**, similar to TF-IDF retrieval
  * Infer content from *related sites* in the same topical cluster

## 🔍 Observations From Tests

### ### 1. **CSR Rendering Issues**

The `destination.html` file is used as a test page.
Its navigation and `<head>` content depend on CSR JavaScript, which **OpenAI’s crawlers cannot execute**.

When testing with `"external_web_access": false`, outputs are shallow and incomplete — confirming that:

> OpenAI’s cached index does not execute JavaScript and cannot render CSR-dependent content.

### 2. **Testing With Forced IP Location (London, UK)**

The app supports passing an approximate user location.
With IP location set manually:

* Outputs tend to be less prone to hallucinations

---

### 3. **Testing Without IP Location**

When location is *not* specified:

* The output becomes more verbose and more exposed to hallucinations.
* ChatGPT-User may reference related domains (e.g., *lopesan.com*)
IMAGE

* This suggests fallback behaviour based on:

  * **Broader cached index context**
  * **Semantic similarity retrieval**
  * Possibly **TF-IDF-like ranking** or embedding-based semantic recall

This hints that ChatGPT-User may synthesize answers even without accessing the target page, by leveraging neighbouring documents or topic clusters.

## 💭 Interpretation & Open Questions

The behaviour raises several interesting hypotheses:

* Does OpenAI maintain a large cached HTML index behind the scenes?
* When a page is missing, does ChatGPT interpolate content from nearest-neighbour documents?
* Are TF-IDF, BM25, or embedding-based retrieval used to synthesize fallback answers?
* Does user IP influence grounding behaviour or cached index selection?

## 🙌 Feedback Welcomed

If you’ve observed similar behaviour or have insights into OpenAI’s caching, retrieval, or grounding mechanisms, please feel free to share your thoughts.
This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome — especially improvements around rule-based conditional clauses that serves the interpretation output.
